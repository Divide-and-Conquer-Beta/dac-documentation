### Text Instructions
1) If you have a previous version of Divide and Conquer installed, remove or rename the "Divide_and_Conquer" folder from this location: [your path]`\Medieval II Total War\mods`

2) Download the file

3) Unzip the file to any location and keep the 6 files inside together (5 .bin files and 1 .exe)

4) Run the executable (DaC v5.exe).

5) The installer should automatically detect your Medieval II Total War folder- if not, you'll need to manually locate your your path. For Steam installations, refer to the below path, and click on the 'Medieval II Total War' folder:
[DRIVE]/steam/steamapps/common

Make sure your path does not list 'Medieval II Total War' twice!

6) You may need to delete your Virtual Store entry for Medieval 2. [Here is a link to the moddb page that has two tutorials.](https://www.moddb.com/mods/divide-and-conquer/downloads/divide-and-conquer-v5-a-kingdom-reunited) 

Note: The Divide and Conquer Launcher is now capable of running Large Address Aware on the Medieval2.exe when required, so this is no longer done during installation.

Note: If your Anti-Virus or Windows Defender flags the installer, this is a false positive. You'll need to add an exclusion
